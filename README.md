### Getting Started
This document aims to explain in an easy way how to run the project and visualize the results in a Jupyter Notebook.

### Prerequisites
If not yet installed, please install these following programs using a command line console (CLI) *(Git Bash, Windows Powershell, Iterm2, etc.)* of your choosing:

1. Download and install [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install)
2. Once Jupyter Notebook installed, you can start it by running the command `jupyter` in a CLI or simply run the GUI application.
3. Install the imported package **ipywidgets**

In case of errors, you can always google-search for quick fixes or use the reference of the corresponding official web page for more information about those errors.

### Run the notebook 
The script in the notebook also includes the API key required to send requests to Open Weather Map. Recall that it's a free subscription, hence we're restricted to certain limitations like the number of requests (60 max) per minute, for example.

**NOTES**: Before running the notebook, make sure that any relative paths to the `assets` folder are correctly set. 

*PS: If for some reasons, you cannot run it on your local machine, feel free to contact me at [r.florent@jacobs-university.de](r.florent@jacobs-university.de). Remember, I'm just an email away from you.*
